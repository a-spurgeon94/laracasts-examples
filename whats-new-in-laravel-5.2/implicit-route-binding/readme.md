# Implicit Route Binding

Published - Dec. 10th 2015

Description - Laravel has offered route model binding for some time now. However, with Laravel 5.2, much of this process is now implicit. Need to fetch a record by its id? Just typehint the model, and Laravel will automatically send you the proper instance of it.
